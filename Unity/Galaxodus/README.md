Galaxodus
=========

Galaxodus is a co-op sci-fi twin stick shooter for the PC which I worked on during my time with Game Tonic Interactive. The code in this folder is snippets that I personally coded for use in the game. The website for the company is: http://gametonicinteractive.co.uk/ and the website for the game is: http://www.galaxodus.uk/

A couple of things to mention; Galaxodus was my introduction to network programming so it may not be as efficient as a more experienced programmer may produce. Secondly, the coding convention used decided against the use of properties, that is which they aren't used here but if it was my own project I would've used them as I prefer them in C#.

All code here is licensed with the CC0 1.0 license so anyone can feel free to use it, change it, improve it, etc.
