Galaxodus
=========

Galaxodus is a co-op sci-fi twin stick shooter for the PC. The code in this folder is snippets that I personally coded for use in the game. The games website is here: http://www.galaxodus.uk/

All code here is licensed with the CC0 1.0 license so anyone can feel free to go ahead and change it, improve it, etc.

A couple of things to mention; Galaxodus was my introduction to network programming so it may not be as efficient as a more experience programmer may produce. Secondly, the coding convention used decided against the use of properties, that is which they aren't used here but if it was my own project I would've used them as I prefer them in C#.
